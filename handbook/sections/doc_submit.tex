\section{Document Submission}

Teams will be required to submit a photo of their robot before the competition so that we will be able to identify robots with their team names. We want this photo to be as up-to-date as possible, so feel free to submit it as late as the week leading up to the competition. \newline

\noindent
Teams must also submit a name for their robot, which they will do with their registration form. The registration form and payment must be submitted by Saturday, March 21st, 2020. \newline
