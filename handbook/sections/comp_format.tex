\section{Competition Format}

There are 15 minutes allotted for each Match. The first 5 minutes of this is transition and setup time. This leaves exactly 10 minutes of time to run the robot on the field and acquire points. Teams that take longer than 5 minutes of setup will start eating into their 10 minute run time unless an extension is granted by the judges. Match order will be randomly chosen at the start of the competition day. Each team will play three Matches in total. All three rounds of Matches will be in the same order, so all teams have the same amount of time between Matches. There will be breaks between each of the three rounds of Matches, described in the Schedule section. Two fields will be set up so two teams will compete at once. During the match, one team representative will stay with the bot at the field while the rest of the team will head to the spectator area.
