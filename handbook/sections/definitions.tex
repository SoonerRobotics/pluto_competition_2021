\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Team Representative}
A member of the team who will remain at the field.

\subsection{Dock}
The starting area, a hub in the center of the field. 

\subsection{Shipping Containers}
The four objects that the robot must transport and deliver. The containers are identical in shape, being 4 inches by 4 inches by 8 inches and made of wood. Each container is fully painted a single unique color; these colors are red, blue, yellow, and black. Initially they will be placed horizontally in the Dock. 

\subsection{Branch}
One of the four pathways extending out of the Dock. Each Branch is a single color which matches one of the containers, and contains a delivery zone where the container must be taken to. Branches may have more than one possible solution, and it could be possible to deliver containers without traversing the entire Branch. 

\subsection{Delivery Zone}
An area on the ground at the end of each Branch marked by colored tape. The container must be taken here to deliver it. A delivered container must be on the ground, not in contact with the robot, and completely within the zone. 

\subsection{Completed}
A Branch will be marked as Completed when the robot brings the container to the Delivery Zone and returns to the Dock. Time Bonus points will be acquired and locked in upon Completing a Branch.
