\section{Competition Overview}

You are tasked with constructing a robot capable of moving shipping containers from the Dock to their individually colored Delivery Zones. The robot will operate in a shipyard on Pluto which receives shipments of supplies that need to be delivered to their destinations. The atmosphere on Pluto does not allow humans or other life forms to oversee this work directly, so the robot must be able to be controlled wirelessly from a distance, seeing only through a camera and sensors placed directly on the robot. Each container destination is blocked by some kind of obstacle, which is unique to each colored Branch.
