\section{Awards}

Final scores are used to determine ranked awards. Trophies will be given for teams ranked first, second, and third overall. A trophy will also be given to the team winning the Innovative Design Award. This is a judges’ choice award given to the team with the most simultaneously creative and functional design. Ideally robots with “innovative design” are capable of controlling the container more successfully and distinctly than other teams, and are technically able to complete any of the four Branches. This award winner will be chosen by our faculty panel.
